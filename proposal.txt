Proposal:
Semantic Segmentation in Underwater Imagery
Complexity: ★★★ (High)
Motivation:
Underwater object segmentation is crucial for enabling autonomous underwater robotics,
providing essential scene understanding capabilities that directly support critical marine
exploration and intervention tasks. AUVs (Autonomous Underwater Vehicles) and ROVs
(Remotely Operated Vehicles) require robust object segmentation techniques to be able to
distinguish between critical elements like marine structures, biological organisms, geologi-
cal features, and potential hazards, which is fundamental for safe and effective underwater
operations. Leveraging Machine Learning models to transform visual data into precise spa-
tial understanding allows robotic systems to navigate, interact with, and analyze complex
underwater environments with enhanced perception and decision-making capabilities.
Dataset:
• Dataset Size: 1635 images.
• Annotations: The objects in each image belong to one of 8 classes (waterbody back-
ground, human divers, aquatic plants/flora, wrecks/ruins, robots and instruments, reefs
and other invertebrates, fish and other vertebrates, sea-floor and rocks). The pixels of
each object are colored according to the corresponding class. The segmentation labels
are provided as masks, using a set of 3-bit binary RGB colors to represent the eight
categories.
• Format: image.jpg and mask.bmp

Challenge:
1. Propose a custom AI model to perform object segmentation in underwater images.
2. Train and test the AI-model without and with data augmentation.
3. Use the following metrics to assess the quality of your implementation:
• IoU of training and testing;
• Model complexity (# parameters).
4. Compare the results of your AI-model with at least 2 existing models (e.g., ResNet,
VGG, or other), one of which should be SUIM-Net (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.
01241).
5. Discuss the obtained results.
